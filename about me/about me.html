        <h3> Hi, I'm Erick Aguilar. I'm from Guatemala, I have 10 years of married with 
            my beutiful wife and I'm passionate about technology and music, 
            especially when it comes to bass. 
            My job allows me to apply my technical skills to help companies troubleshoot and improve their systems. 
            But when I'm not working, I like to play bass with my band or just enjoy other artists' music. 
            I am also a huge fan of video games and enjoy spending time on my favorite games. 
            I believe that technology and music are two incredible forms of expression and creativity, 
            and I feel lucky to be able to work in both fields.</h3>
